# DATA SCIENCE COURSE PROJECT
## Getting and Cleaning Data

### The project - 
*  Download data
*  Write R script called run_analysis.R that will 
*       Merge training and test sets using only mean and standard deviation
*       Creates second, independent tidy data set with averages of each variable for each activity and subject


### Steps
*  Download data into Coursera folder on desktop.  You will now have a UCI HAR Dataset folder
*  Go to Rstudio and set working directory to the UCI HAR DAtaset folder
*  Source("run_analysis.R") which outputs tidy_data.txt 

### Dependencies
* The code provides for the installation of data.table and reshape2 packages automatically
